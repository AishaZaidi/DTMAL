# Datalogical Thinking Project Template
This GitHub template was designed to help students of the [*Datalogical Thinking*](https://www.hb.se/globalassets/global/international-office/kursplaner-ischool/ht23_datalogical-thinking-c3mdt1.pdf) course get started with their group project work. 

## About the Assignment
For this assignments, students work together in a group to curate 
a dataset, and use pseudocode to design an algorithm to process that dataset in a meaningful way. Students are asked to publish their dataset and algorithm on GitHub, alongside a simple website with some basic information on their project, dataset, and algorithm -- to be hosted using GitHub Pages. Students can use this template as a starting point to organize their GitHub repositories.

## About the Course
*Datalogical Thinking* is a course taught at the [University of Borås](https://www.hb.se) (Sweden), as part of the [MA in Information Science: Digital Environments](https://www.hb.se/en/international-student/program/programmes/masters-programme-in-information-science-digital-environments/). The course, in its current form, was designed by Wout Dillen, and taught for the first time in the autumn of 2023, with the help of his colleagues David Gunnarson Lorentzen, Kayvan Yousefi Mojir, Elisa Tattersall Wallin, and Anton Carlander Borgström.
This dataset is part of our Assignment 2: Algorithm Design (Project Work) for the Datalogical thinking course. It is a curated metadata collection derived from open digital book https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lokeshparab/gutenberg-books-and-metadata-2025.
