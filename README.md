#### Algorithm design
###Step 1: Conceptualization
This dataset is part of our Assignment 2: Algorithm Design (Project Work) for the Datalogical thinking course. It is a curated metadata collection derived from open source digital book https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lokeshparab/gutenberg-books-and-metadata-2025.

### Step 2: Curation of our Dataset
Dataset Overview
Column Name 
(ID): unique identifier for each item in the dataset.
(Type)The kind of record  (Text/audio)
(Issued)The year or date when the item was first published.
(Title)The title or name of the work.
(Language)The primary language of the work (e.g., English, French, German).
(Authors)The creator(s) or main contributors of the work.
(Subjects)Thematic keywords or categories describing the content (e.g., Fiction, Science, History).
Data Preparation before inclusion in the repository:
The data was cleaned and formatted into CSV structure.
Extra symbols, missing rows, and formatting errors were removed.
All records were validated to ensure at least 100 entries, fulfilling assignment requirements.
Intended Use:
This dataset will be used to design and test an algorithmic model that processes bibliographic metadata.
License & Usage:
This dataset is intended for educational purposes only within the context of the Assignment 2 group project.
It is used under fair use for analysis, visualization, and algorithmic exploration.
