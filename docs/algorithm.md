# Algorithm: CountPopularSubjects
### Goal
Figure out which subject shows up the most in the library records.
## Pseudocode
BEGIN

    # Step 1: Setup
    # Load the data file

    subjectTally <- empty dictionary

    # Records without subject info
    missingSubjects <- 0   

# Step 2: Go through each record
    FOR each entry IN records DO
totalChecked <- totalChecked + 1
 # Step 3: Grab the subject
  subject <- trim(to_lowercase(entry["Subjects"]))
  # Step 4: Check if subject is usable
        IF subject != "" THEN
# Step 5: Count it

# Step 7: Find the most common one

        IF subjectTally[subject] > topCount THEN
            topCount <- subjectTally[subject]
